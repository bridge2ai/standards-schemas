High-level classes for Bridge2AI Standards schemas.


### Classes

 * [DataSubstrateContainer](DataSubstrateContainer.md) - A container for DataSubstrates.
 * [DataTopicContainer](DataTopicContainer.md) - A container for DataTopics.
 * [NamedThing](NamedThing.md) - A generic grouping for any identifiable entity
     * [AnatomicalEntity](AnatomicalEntity.md) - A subcellular location, cell type or gross anatomical part
     * [DataStandardOrTool](DataStandardOrTool.md) - Represents a standard or tool in the Bridge2AI Standards Registry.
         * [DataStandard](DataStandard.md) - Represents a general purpose standard in the Bridge2AI Standards Registry.
             * [BiomedicalStandard](BiomedicalStandard.md) - Represents a standard in the Bridge2AI Standards Registry with particular applications or relevance to clinical or biomedical research purposes.
         * [ModelRepository](ModelRepository.md) - Represents a resource in the Bridge2AI Standards Registry serving to curate and store computational models. To be a repository, the resource must not index models alone.
         * [OntologyOrVocabulary](OntologyOrVocabulary.md) - A set of concepts and categories, potentially defined or accompanied by their hierarchical relationships.
         * [ReferenceDataOrDataset](ReferenceDataOrDataset.md) - Represents a resource in the Bridge2AI Standards Registry serving as a standardized, reusable data source.
         * [ReferenceImplementation](ReferenceImplementation.md) - Represents an implementation of one or more standards or tools in the Bridge2AI Standards Registry, whether as a full specification in a particular language or as an application to a specific use case.
         * [Registry](Registry.md) - Represents a resource in the Bridge2AI Standards Registry serving to curate and/or index other resources.
         * [SoftwareOrTool](SoftwareOrTool.md) - Represents a piece of software or computational tool in the Bridge2AI Standards Registry.

     * [DataSubstrate](DataSubstrate.md) - Represents a data substrate for Bridge2AI data. This may be a high-level data structure or a specific implementation of that structure. Interpret as "data, in this form or format", as compared to DataStandard, which refers to the set of rules defining a standard. For example, data in TSV format is represented as a DataSubstrate but the concept of TSV format is a DataStandard.
     * [DataTopic](DataTopic.md) - Represents a general data topic for Bridge2AI data or the tools/standards applied to the data.
     * [Organization](Organization.md) - Represents a group or organization related to or responsible for one or more Bridge2AI standards.
     * [UseCase](UseCase.md) - Represents a use case for Bridge2AI standards.
 * [OrganizationContainer](OrganizationContainer.md) - A container for Organizations.
 * [UseCaseContainer](UseCaseContainer.md) - A container for UseCase.
