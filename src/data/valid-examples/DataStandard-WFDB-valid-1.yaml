name: WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) Format
description: The WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) format is a widely-used standard for storing physiological signals and annotations. Originally developed for cardiac signals, WFDB now supports a wide range of physiological waveform data including ECG, EEG, blood pressure, and respiratory waveforms. The format consists of binary signal files and text header files that describe the signal properties, making it efficient for long-term physiological recordings while maintaining compatibility across platforms.
