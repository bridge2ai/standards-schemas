use_case_category: acquisition
name: Obtain patient data from records of clinical visits.
category: UseCase
description: "Collecting clinical data from patient visits involves the process of gathering information about a patient's medical history, current symptoms, and other relevant information during a healthcare appointment. This typically includes taking a detailed medical history, conducting a physical examination, ordering and interpreting diagnostic tests, and documenting the findings in the patient's medical record. This may also include more focused evaluations, as with the AI-READI projectâ€™s assessments of cognitive function and visual acuity. Medical records may include structured/unstructured text, values for lab results, and/or images."
