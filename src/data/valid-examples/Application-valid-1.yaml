# Example Application showing how FHIR standard is applied to a clinical AI decision support system

id: B2AI_APP:101
category: B2AI:Application
name: AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support for Sepsis Prediction
description: >-
  An artificial intelligence application that uses machine learning models to predict
  early onset of sepsis in hospitalized patients. The system integrates electronic health
  record data standardized using FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to
  enable real-time risk assessment and alert generation for clinical care teams.
