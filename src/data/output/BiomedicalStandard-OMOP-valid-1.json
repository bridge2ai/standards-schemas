  "description": "The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) is a standardized data model that enables systematic analysis of disparate observational databases. The CDM provides a common format and content, as well as standard vocabularies to encode healthcare data from diverse sources. It is designed to standardize the structure and content of observational data to enable efficient analyses that can produce reliable evidence.",
